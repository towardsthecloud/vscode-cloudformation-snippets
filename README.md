> **Stop AWS bill surprises before they ship.**
>
> Most infrastructure changes look harmless until next month's AWS bill lands. [CloudBurn](https://cloudburn.io) analyzes the cost impact of your AWS CDK changes right in the GitHub pull request, so expensive mistakes get caught during code review, while a fix is still a one-line change.

> 1. **Install the free [CDK Diff PR Commenter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-cdk-diff-pr-commenter)** in the repository where you build your AWS CDK infrastructure
> 2. **Then install the [CloudBurn GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/cloudburn-io)** on the same repository
>
> From then on, every PR with infrastructure changes gets a comment with your CDK diff analysis, and CloudBurn adds a cost report next to it:
> - **Monthly cost impact**: whether this change raises or lowers your AWS bill, and by how much
> - **Per-resource breakdown**: which resources drive the change, old versus new monthly cost
> - **Region-aware pricing**: rates match the region your infrastructure actually deploys to
>
> Cost review happens inside code review, so you optimize as you code, while the context is still fresh.
>
> CloudBurn is free during beta. After launch, a free Community plan (1 repository, unlimited users) stays available.

## Usage

1. Install the [CloudFormation Snippets extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dannysteenman.cloudformation-yaml-snippets) in VS Code.
2. Create a new `.yml` or `.json` file.
3. Ensure the file type is set to "YAML" or "JSON" in the bottom right corner of VS Code.
4. Type cfn to insert the basic CloudFormation template structure.
5. Add resources using their short prefix (e.g. `s3-bucket` for `AWS::S3::Bucket`).

Example of auto-completion in action:

and an example of the hover information:

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 5), the corresponding snippet will show up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 5).
